# Caesar Cipher Text Encryption

This project implements a simple Caesar Cipher text encryption and decryption tool using Python.  
It demonstrates the concept of substitution ciphers, where each letter in the text is shifted by a fixed number of positions.

## Features
- Encrypt text using Caesar Cipher
- Decrypt encrypted text
- User-defined shift value
- Simple and beginner-friendly implementation

## Technologies Used
- Python

## How It Works
1. Each character in the text is shifted by a fixed number (key)
2. Encryption shifts characters forward
3. Decryption shifts characters backward
4. Non-alphabet characters remain unchanged

## How to Run
```bash
python caesar_cipher.py
